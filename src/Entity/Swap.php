/**
 * TWO CELLS, SENT TO THE HANDSET FOR ACCEPTANCE.
 *
 * RULED: "a swap is two cells and a cost bar, accepted on the handset." Two
 * cells is the whole shape — the duty somebody is giving up, and either the
 * duty they want in exchange or simply the person they are asking to take
 * it. A one-sided hand-over and a true exchange are the same object with the
 * second cell null or not, because they are the same conversation.
 *
 * AN OFFER IS NOT AN EDIT, and that is the reason this is an entity rather
 * than a column on a duty. Until the other person accepts, BOTH duties stand
 * exactly as the rotation generated them: the week grid reads as though no
 * swap existed, the handset shows the original watches, and nobody has been
 * moved without agreeing. A duty officer who could accept on somebody's
 * behalf could move a ranger's rest day without telling them, which is
 * precisely what a swap exists not to be.
 *
 * IT IS KEPT AFTER IT RESOLVES. A declined or withdrawn swap is a fact about
 * a week somebody may have to read back — "we did ask, and they said no" —
 * and deleting it makes a hole look like one nobody tried to fill.
 *
 * THE ACCEPTANCE MOVES THE DUTIES AND THIS ROW RECORDS THAT IT DID. The
 * duties are the roster; this is the agreement that changed them.
