/**
 * `roster_url(route, parameters)` — the URL of a screen, or NULL where the
 * installation did not mount it.
 *
 * WHY A MODULE NEEDS THIS AT ALL. Every roster screen prints a breadcrumb, and a
 * patrol breadcrumb names screens this module does not own: the area register
 * and the area itself belong to AreaBundle, and the per-area module
 * grid belongs to the registry and is not built yet. Twig's own `path()` THROWS on a
 * route that is not registered, so a template naming any of them is a template
 * that takes the whole page down in an installation that mounted one screen
 * fewer.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. Area's own screens are optional — its README calls
 * both of its shell contribution points "route-tolerant: unmount a route and its tab or row is
 * simply absent rather than every page failing" — and this is the same tolerance
 * applied to a crumb rather than to a tab.
 *
 * A NULL IS RENDERED AS PLAIN TEXT, never as a dead link and never as a silently
 * missing step: the trail still says where the page sits, and only the parts a
 * visitor can actually travel to are clickable.
 *
 * Registered as a Twig extension rather than resolved in each controller because
 * a crumb is page furniture: every screen prints one, they print the same prefix,
 * and threading it through every render call would be a chance to build it
 * differently.
