/**
 * HOW FAR A SWAP HAS GOT.
 *
 * THE HANDSET ACCEPTS, AND NOBODY ELSE CAN. A swap is an OFFER between two
 * people; a duty officer who could accept on somebody's behalf would be a
 * duty officer who can move a ranger's rest day without telling them, and
 * the whole reason a swap is not just an edit is that the other person
 * agreed.
 *
 * AN OFFER THAT IS NOT ACCEPTED CHANGES NOTHING. Until it is, both duties
 * stand exactly as the rotation generated them and the roster reads as
 * though no swap existed — which is what makes an unaccepted swap safe to
 * leave open over a weekend.
