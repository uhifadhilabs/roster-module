/**
 * ONE POST ON ONE DAY — who was rostered, how each of their days reads, and
 * the post's own state derived from the two.
 *
 * THE JOIN NEITHER SIDE CAN MAKE ALONE, and that is the whole reason this
 * object exists. The AREA knows who reported and what their positions say;
 * it does not know who was SUPPOSED to be on, and says so. This module knows
 * who was due and nothing about whether they came. The absence of a reported
 * day against a rostered watch is the "no check-in" a board draws, and only
 * a caller holding both can see it.
 *
 * THE STATE IS DERIVED HERE AND STORED NOWHERE, like everything else in this
 * chain: there is no offline flag to be left set after a handset comes back,
 * and no nightly job whose failure would freeze an area in yesterday's truth.
