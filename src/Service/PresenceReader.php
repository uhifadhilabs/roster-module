/**
 * WHO IS ACTUALLY ON — this module's ONE reading of presence, and it
 * COMPUTES NONE OF IT.
 *
 * PRESENCE IS THE AREA'S, RULED. The claim, the positions, the catchment
 * and the verdict on all three are derived by the area bundle and read here
 * through {@see PresenceProviderInterface}. This class does exactly one
 * thing the area cannot: it JOINS that reading to who was rostered. The
 * area says plainly that it does not hold who was supposed to be on, and
 * the absence of a reported day against a rostered watch is the "no
 * check-in" a board draws — a fact only a caller holding both sides can
 * see.
 *
 * THE POST'S STATE IS THE ONE THING THIS MODULE DERIVES, because it is a
 * property of the WATCH and not of the day: reporting, late and offline are
 * measured against thresholds this module owns on the post
 * ({@see StationWatch}). Everything about a PERSON comes from the area
 * unchanged.
 *
 * ONE CALL PER DAY, NOT ONE PER PERSON. `dayIn()` answers a whole area at
 * once and is asked once here; a station card that asked per row would put
 * a query behind every name on a control-room screen that is open all day.
