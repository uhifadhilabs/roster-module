/**
 * OFFERING A SWAP, AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE IS ACCEPTED.
 *
 * ACCEPTING IS THE ONLY THING THAT MOVES ANYBODY. Offering changes nothing:
 * both duties stand as the rotation generated them, the week grid reads as
 * though no swap existed, and the handset shows the original watches. That
 * is what makes an unaccepted offer safe to leave open over a weekend.
 *
 * AN ACCEPTED SWAP MARKS BOTH DAYS AS EDITED, and this is the line that
 * matters most: the nightly generator would otherwise regenerate those days
 * from the ring and put everybody back where the pattern says they belong,
 * quietly undoing an agreement two people made. Marking the day is how the
 * generator is told to step over it — the same mechanism a duty officer's
 * hand edit uses, because it is the same fact: somebody decided this day is
 * not what the pattern says.
 *
 * ONE OPEN OFFER PER WATCH. Two people cannot both be asked to take the same
 * cell — whichever accepted second would find the watch already gone, and
 * the roster would depend on who tapped first.
