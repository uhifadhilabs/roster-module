/**
 * THE AGENDA: which posts and which people the day is showing, and the five
 * figures over them.
 *
 * THE FILTER IS APPLIED TO THE READING, NOT TO THE QUERY. The area answers
 * the whole day in one read; narrowing it here rather than asking again is
 * what lets the option counts on the filter row be TRUE — an option that
 * says "1 unverified" because it counted the same answer the rows came from
 * can never disagree with the rows.
 *
 * THE FIGURES ARE OF THE WHOLE DAY, NOT OF THE FILTER. A strip that changed
 * when somebody narrowed to one post would be answering a different question
 * from the one it is labelled with, and "2 need an answer" would mean "2 of
 * the ones you are looking at" — which is how a dashboard comes to under-report
 * a problem to the person filtering for it.
